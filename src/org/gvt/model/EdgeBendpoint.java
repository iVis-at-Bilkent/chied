/**
 * EdgeBendpoint is a Bendpoint that calculates its location based on its
 * distance from the start and end points of the EdgeFigure, as well as its
 * weight. Detailed information can be found in setWeight() method.
 * 
 * Bendpoints are also used in the calculation of its owners (CompoundModel)
 * size. Hence getLocationFromModel() method is implemented to calculate the
 * location of bendpoints by using model information instead of UI information.
 * This is needed because UI is updated after operations according to model are
 * done.
